# Madagascar Vanilla

The best vanilla.

## Why?

For those of us with literally thousands of hours in RimWorld, it can be a pain to reconfigure each new game. This mod aims to reduce the overhead of starting new games by adding settings for things like: choosing manual work priorites, auto-expanding home zone, auto-rebuilding destroyed buildings, etc..

As well, there were a number of quality of life and "house rules" small changes which I wanted to make to RimWorld.

Note: everything is set to RimWorld defaults and must be enabled in the mod settings to take effect.

## What does it do exactly?

* TODO: add list of each optional setting

## Balance

I'd say that 95% of this mod is simple quality of life, with no implact on balance. The other 5% has some small impact, such as allowing players to configure Toxipotatos to life through toxic fallout, or extending the duration of Odyssey quests to more easily accomodate a 100% planet coverage playstyle. Please see the "What does it do exactly" second for a more complete list of all changes, and remember that every change is opt-in.
