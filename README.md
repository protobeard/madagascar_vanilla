# Madagascar Vanilla

The best vanilla.

## Why?

There were a number of quality of life and "house rules" changes which I wanted to make to RimWorld.

## What does it do exactly?

## Balance

## Great Minds Think Alike

## How to Install

* Unzip the contents and place them in your RimWorld/Mods folder.
* Activate the mod in the mod menu in the game.

## Compatibity

* Can be added and removed to existing saves.
* Not extensively tested, but this should be compatible with most other mods.

## License

* [MIT][license] -- feel free to use as you see fit. If you want to include this mod in a mod pack, or base a larger mod off of it, I'd appreciate a heads up. Please don't upload standalone translated versions on Steam; if you wish to translate it, please create a pull request on GitHub and I'll merge it in.
