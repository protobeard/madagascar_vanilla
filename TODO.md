# TODO

* Make odyssey quest extension xml patch use the multiplier setting. Clean up the multiplier setting label.


# MAYBE

* Makes the Smooth Surface designator available from the Structure menu (I keep looking for it there).
* Makes the stockpile for shelves empty by default (I'm tired of pawns delivering weapons to shelf 1 while I'm waiting for shelf 2 to finish building before setting both of their stockpiles to what I actually want).

* Add links of various QOL/Tweak mods
    * link mehni's misc modifications?
